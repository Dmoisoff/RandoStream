## RandoStream

This is a React frontend that queries the Twitch api and takes 10 random streams out of the top 100. It takes those results and displays their thumbnail in the wheel and spins them. The wheel will land on a thumbnail and then display the stream associated with it.

This is an exercise in creating a random selector in the style of a spinning wheel.
