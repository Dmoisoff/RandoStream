This is a React frontend that queries the Twitch api and takes 10 random streams out of the top 100 current streams. It displays the thumbnails of the results in the wheel and spins them. The wheel will land on a random thumbnail and then display the stream associated with it.

This is an exercise in creating a random selector and styling a spinning wheel to display the results.
